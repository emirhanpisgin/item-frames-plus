# Item Frames Plus
Minecraft Fabric Mod makes item frames more useful by shrinking hitboxes and making them invisible.

# How To Install
- Go to https://modrinth.com/mod/itemframesplus/versions.
- Download the version you want and drop it to your mods folder.

# Usage
- Shift and Right Click to any item frame to make it invisible.
- Since the Invisible Item Frame feature is server-side, you can always disable in the client by typing /itemframesplus invisibleItemFrames false.
